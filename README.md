# GITHUB-VISUALIZATION

Visualization of some data from the GitHub API.

> I have completed this assignment using R.

This is a comparison between the number of followers and the number of repositories among the GitHub community. In the beginning, I expected to see a linear relationship between this data, and who is more active in terms of the number of repositories, have more followers, but everything turned out differently. I also pie plot, which shows the language among all the repositories created by the current user.
The main issue with that project was a big rude limitation of request amount during hour, which is 5000 requests, but in my functions, I avoid that problem with ‘Sys.sleep’ for hour. But the algorithms work quite a lot of time to extract all data about users.

> Note: I have put plots with my visualization and .csv file with data in this repository.
